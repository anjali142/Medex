<p>Exercise is helpful in managing worry, as exercising releases brain chemicals that counteract anxiety and low mood. It also gives time away from worries, and works off “nervous energy.” It is recommended that people do at least a half hour a day, three days a week, of cardio exercise.</p>

<div class="et_pb_text_inner">
<p>Use structured problem solving to deal with stressors that may contribute to worry. When faced with difficult life problems, many people do not have adequate coping skills and consequently feel that they are not able to control what is happening to them. These feelings contribute greatly to the development of worry. While everybody has problems in their lives, these problems can become more apparent and more difficult to manage if you are prone to worry. Training in structured problem solving may be extremely useful. Effective problem solving skills can reduce, minimize, control, or even prevent excessive worrying in daily living.</p>

<p>If you avoid situations or activities because of anxiety, gradually confront the things you fear using graded exposure. For example, a hierarchy, depending on how fearful you find each step, could be:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #e67e22;"><strong>1.</strong></span> Not checking the phone for one hour<br>

<p>Most people with This illness commonly make two errors in their thinking: overestimation (they overestimate the likelihood of something bad happening; i.e., “This will be a disaster; I had better prepare for the worst”) and underestimation (they underestimate their ability to cope; i.e., “I will have a breakdown; I won’t be able to control myself”). Challenge these worrying thoughts by learning to recognize distressing thoughts, testing whether the thought is realistic (i.e., “What evidence do I have that does not support these thoughts?”), and identifying more realistic alternatives (i.e., “How likely is it that my fearful predictions will actually occur?”)</p>

<div class="et_pb_blurb_description">
<p>People with This illness should also work toward challenging their beliefs and assumptions about themselves. For example, your worry might be “I’ll never be prepared in time,” which may be accompanied by the assumption that “if anything goes wrong, it’s my fault” and the underlying belief that “I am a failure.” Cognitive therapy strategies can help you identify and challenge these assumptions and develop alternative and more realistic beliefs.</p>
